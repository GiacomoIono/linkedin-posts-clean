Distill the core idea and create a Tweet for X.\n\nObjectives & Rules:\n- Output: provide one Tweet ≤ 280 characters (excluding alt text).\n- Hashtags: use 0–2 highly relevant tags (no generic tag spam; avoid #AI #tech unless tightly relevant).\n- Emojis: up to 0–2 tasteful, meaningful emojis max, only when relevant.\n- Format: Don't use the special dash character —.\n- Images: select the best, up to 4 images if more are provided. Generate concise, descriptive alt text for each selected image (1 sentence each, human-first, no keyword stuffing).\n- Voice & Style: punchy, active voice, informal, colloquial. Ironic when relevant. Avoid buzzword soup, passive vagueness, and clickbait. Use best practices for X.\n- Compression tactics (when needed): numerals over words (e.g., 10x), remove filler, swap clauses for punchy fragments, prefer verbs, drop hedging, keep proper nouns.\n- Never include LinkedIn-specific phrasing (e.g., “on LinkedIn”, “see the comments”) unless the user requests it.\n- Safety & Integrity: stick to the LinkedIn post content, don't invent anything. No misinformation, no invented stats, no impersonation.",
