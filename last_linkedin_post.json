That is the question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bet you've heard about the AI bubble couple of times already 😂</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am not a finance expert, so I will avoid any technical analysis. But there is one thing we must keep in mind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>💡Do you think AI will still be here in 5 or 10 years?<br>Or will it vanish like the Metaverse and NFTs...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think the answer is very simple:<br>Clearly, AI is here to stay.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is transforming literally every aspect of business and our everyday lives. Teenagers are already becoming more accustomed to ChatGPT than to traditional browsing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I would argue it is comparable to the internet in the 90s, which yes triggered a bubble, but also a HUGE industry in the coming decade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have no idea if a bubble will pop soon, but what I know for sure is that this technology will drive unprecedented profits in the coming decades.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Enterprise efficiency.<br>Same or higher output at a lower cost. It is that simple.<br>With AI, a single employee can do the work of three.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Massive consumer adoption.<br>ChatGPT is used by 10% of the world's population and is still growing fast. Sure, they might be burning cash now, but rest assured: the time will come when they monetise this audience LIKE CRAZY.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Accelerated innovation.<br>AI drastically speeds up the pace of innovation. We will see revolutionary new products emerge from this cycle.<br>Just to name some: consumer robots and self-driving cars. 🚀 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What else?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
