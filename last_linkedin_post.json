Nor I know enough about it to choose the right artist or album.<br>I just want to relax while I’m at home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So it dawned on me:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Behaviour ≠ Intent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My behaviour: streaming 100 hours of 50s jazz.<br>My intent: white noise for cooking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When marketers obsess over data, they often miss the context.<br>Numbers alone don't tell the full story.<br>Often, they even tell the wrong story! like in this case.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I’m now being targeted with ads for jazz gigs and ergonomic armchairs 😂<br>I am going to be a terrible ROI for those companies!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rather, I should get ads for kitchenware.
