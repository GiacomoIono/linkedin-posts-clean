Without EVER clicking and visiting external sites/apps.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This happens in ChatGPT, Gemini etc, but also on Google itself with Ai Overviews and Ai Mode.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And if you add GPTAgent to the mix, then you really have a revolution unfolding before your eyes!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's a huge disruption, that impacts every aspect of marketing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From content, to media buying, to user targeting, even to how marketing teams are organised and their role within organisations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It also impacts marketing measurement.<br>How can we prove marketing ROI without clicks or traffic?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I tried to make sense of all of this last week and I really enjoyed the deep discussion we had afterwards. Lot of food for thoughts!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But we're just at the very beginning of this revolution and I'm looking forward to what it'll bring next!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
