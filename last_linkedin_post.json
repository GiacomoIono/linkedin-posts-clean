I wasn’t spared either, I once got a free helicopter ride off the slopes (too bad I was unconscious and missed the view 😅).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I feel the same principle applies to our careers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Competition is so strong that grinding until burn out seems to be the only way to succeed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is it even worth it?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Depends.<br>If your goal is to win, this is the only path. And many people like to win.<br>Although many more get injured on the way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But maybe there’s another path.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One where sport values health and fun over extreme competition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One where “winning” isn’t the only measure of success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One where professional relationships are human-relationships first and not a mean to “win” the next promotion, the next role etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One where hard quality work is more valued than winning at all costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But I guess the idea of winning is so embedded in our society that we rather see another 18-year-old die than changing our perspective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
