Licensing deals. Sponsored results.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine booking a flight:<br>“Hey ChatGPT, book me a flight from X to Y.”<br>“Sure, here’s your booking.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe the backend is Booking.com, but I’ll never see it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At that point, “web” analytics becomes brutally simple:<br>“How many bookings did ChatGPT send us this month?”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unless your brand is strong enough that people ask explicitly:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Book me a flight with Booking.com.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then, once again, what truly matters is your brand. Nothing else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the essence of the AI Marketing revolution unfolding before our eyes, right now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can’t wait to see how this unfolds!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
