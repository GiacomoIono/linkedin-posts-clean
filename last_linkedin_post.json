Instead, it will redirect you to the merchant's site.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Good news for retailers and publishers, at least for now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Also, no sponsored products yet.<br>But how long until that changes?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI is chasing a massive revenue target:<br>📈 $125 billion in revenue by 2029 (vs <$4 billion today).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ads seem like the most logical next step.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Long live the ad-supported internet and performance marketing!</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
