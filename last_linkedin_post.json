Get $5 back.<br>- Track every single user journey, from ad click to purchase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It worked. For a while.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Until two asteroids hit the marketing planet:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Privacy killed the cookie 🍪<br>-> GDPR and browsers like Safari blocked third-party cookies.<br> The bridge between ad click and purchase started to collapse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2.
