But still less than 10% market share.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Gemini has less than a quarter of GPT’s users. Despite the Google ecosystem, Android default etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI released a paper a couple of months ago that explains exactly what’s happening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They analyzed how people actually use ChatGPT.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The results were unexpected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not for coding. It’s not for work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s mostly used for non-work activities. 🏠<br>• How-to guides<br>• Learning new topics<br>• Searching for quick info</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, ChatGPT has become the ultimate personal assistant for everyday life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And that is their moat.<br>For now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other tools are fighting for the \"specialist\" slice: coding, enterprise workflow, etc</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But for the average person, there is only one default. For now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
