And it wants to use that knowledge across all its apps, including Gemini.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But let’s not forget, it has just lost three consecutive lawsuits for abusing its dominant position.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, for gatekeeping personal data in and competitors out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So is this feature even legal?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I enjoy the process of teaching ChatGPT what to remember about me. It feels like a collaboration, a gradual tuning where I am in full control.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But not sure I’m ready to feed Gemini the mess of my late-night searches during a romantic meltdown ten years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Can I even curate what \"memories\" to pass?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By clicking that \"connect now\" button I'm giving away control over my data.<br>Since I know there's an alternative, I'm not comfortable in doing so.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The GPT \"memories\" and \"custom instructions\" model definitely wins for me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
