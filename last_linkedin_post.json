It's already mainstream.<br>→ 10% of the world's adult population now uses ChatGPT.<br>→ It reached 1/3 of Instagram users, in less than three years.<br>→ Over 70% of all GPT conversations are non-work related.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Massive room for growth.<br>→ The 18-25 age group sends nearly half of all messages.<br>→ Growth in developing countries is exploding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. It's becoming the \"Everything App\".<br>It isn't just a chatbot anymore. It's the gateway to the web:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>→ Personal Assistant: ChatGPT<br>→ Entertainment and social networking: Sora<br>→ Browser: Atlas<br>→ Shopping: Instant Checkout<br>→ App Store: GPT Apps (essentially the new Apple App Store)<br>→ Messaging: Group Chats (just announced!)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Huge potential for monetisation.<br>Yes, it still burns billions.<br>But it's already at $13B+ annual revenue.<br>Facebook took years to even make a single dollar.<br>OpenAI did it on day one.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The path is clear:<br>→ Ads (huge opportunity).<br>→ Commissions from checkouts.<br>→ More tiered subscriptions (free with ads, Lite?, Plus, Pro, Enterprise, etc).<br>→ Massive B2B potential.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile...<br>The other Big Tech giants are too large and slow to keep pace.<br>Yes, even Google.<br>Gemini is growing fast but its market share is still a fraction of ChatGPT.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many are trapped in the innovator's dilemma.<br>OpenAI doesn't fear any dilemma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It managed to disrupt the most powerful companies on earth right where they were strongest: AI & machine learning.<br>Nobody else has ever done that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What else should I add?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
