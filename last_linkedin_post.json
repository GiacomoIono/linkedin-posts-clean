The next I’m deep-diving into a new AI trend.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Almost every week there’s something new in digital marketing that I need to explore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And that’s what I love.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It reminds me of my music days:<br>hours spent experimenting with sounds, learning new riffs, chasing inspiration etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I loved it,<br>but I had no clear structure, and maybe that’s why I never became good enough.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is it the same happening now in my marketing career?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hard to say.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But here’s what I know for sure:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Waking up not knowing how the day will unfold gives me motivation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It keeps my passion alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And considering I now get paid for what feels like play...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>whatever I’m doing seems not to be that wrong. ☺️</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Curious,<br>are there other marketers who feel the same way?</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
