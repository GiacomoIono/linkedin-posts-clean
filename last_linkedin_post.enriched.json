Before leaving, I was warned about everything:<br>Chaos, scams, micro-criminality, garbage and all other common clichés on southern Italy.<br>And the idea of going by train from Zurich genuinely scared colleagues and friends: “You’ll never make it.” they said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What I found instead was…</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No chaos.<br>Yes, there are lot of tourists. Yes, traffic is heavy.<br>But just one street away from the main roads and I found silence and calm. I had beautiful walks in romantic narrow lanes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Clean streets.<br>Of course Naples is not cleaner than Zurich.<br>But is it dirtier than Milan or other Northern Italian cities? Absolutely not.<br>I was very positively surprised.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(Un)surprisingly, everything worked.<br>I used public transport, boats and taxis daily. Always on time, fair prices, zero issues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>People were elegant and polite.<br>Fur coats and fancy suits were a common sight.<br>I was warned of their tough dialect, but I've just heard clean and polite Italian.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The train journey was flawless.<br>Zurich → Milan → Parma → Naples.<br>Then boats to Sorrento and the Amalfi Coast.<br>Every single connection was on time. Sometimes even early.<br>Ironically, the only delay was on the Swiss train back to Zurich.<br>Five minutes late. 😅</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All of this, paired with some of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen.<br>And I say this as an Italian, used to beauty.<br>Some Naples neighbourhoods and the Amalfi Coast are easily among the most stunning places on earth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a reminder for the next time you believe clichés.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
