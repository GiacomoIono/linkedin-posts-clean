Yet, everything to do with all the rest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It’s helped me put things into perspective… and realise how lucky I am to live right now, in Europe, in this moment of history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ours is a golden age,<br>no questions about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Comparable to Ancient Greece, the Roman Republic, or even Song China.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But cracks are starting to show.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Every golden age has three fundamental elements in common:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Free and open society<br>- Rule of law<br>- Peace</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the foundation for individual inventiveness and innovation.<br>And it’s exactly social and technological innovation that sparks a golden age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ours, clearly, is driven by technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But there’s one more thing golden ages share.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They never last.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Today, open society, rule of law, and peace are being seriously tested.<br>Without them, our golden age won’t survive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The trigger of decline is simple: fear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When fear of decline outweighs belief in progress, decline becomes inevitable, like a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But look at how far we’ve come in just a few decades.<br>And how much more we can still achieve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Decline isn’t imminent.<br>And it’s definitely not inevitable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take one example:<br>the golden ages of the past produced some of humanity’s greatest minds, philosophers, artists, statesmen etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Yet none of them, over thousands of years, ever questioned the role of women in public life or the existence of slavery.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now think of today.<br>And we still have a long way to go!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At this point it’s on us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To choose between fear of decline or faith in progress and peace.<br>And if we choose the latter we need to protect it at all cost!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So in a sense yes, this post is also about AI.<br>Because this technology might just be the spark of an even better golden age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we want it to be. ⚡</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
