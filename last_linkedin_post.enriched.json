It took me 3 minutes while on the bus!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like every year, I'm running late with Christmas gifts.<br>But at least this time I knew exactly what she wanted: a sushi rice maker.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Problem is,<br>I know nothing about sushi. <br>I know nothing about rice makers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And I hate browsing 50 different tabs comparing specs I don't have time to understand. 😭</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But I still tried.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I spent hours researching.<br>Too many options. Too little time.<br>I was burned out before I even clicked \"add to cart.\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Desperate, I tried the new ChatGPT Shopping Research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I typed one prompt: \"find a sushi rice maker under 100chf\".</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My mind was blown 🤯.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of giving me a list of links, it acted like a sales consultant.<br>It asked me the questions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Preferred capacity? (I clicked 1-2 cups).<br>Main features? (I clicked Non-stick & Quick cook).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In minutes, it gave me a single best recommendation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One option. One price. One link.<br>Loved it 😍.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I clicked, paid via TWINT on mobile, delivery is already tomorrow.<br>Christmas is saved. 🎉 </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks ChatGPT!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My takeaway as a marketer:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I usually avoid online shopping because of the \"decision fatigue.\"<br>I really hate browsing products. It drains me.<br>I rather go to a physical shop and just ask the personnel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But this time I didn't browse.<br>No reviews articles, no influencers videos. No links, no clicks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I just asked. And GPT delivered. In minutes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the future of eCommerce, and I’m never going back to browsing again.<br>Many others will do the same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This changes everything in marketing, whether we like it or not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>And you, have you tried AI for holiday shopping yet, or are you still browsing with 15 tabs open? 👇</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
